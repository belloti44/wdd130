            <p>Hello,my name is Isaiah Wambani and I enjoy football so much and reading the scriptures and sharing the gospel of Jesus christ.I am from Nakuru,Kenya ,what a cool place i love to stay.I think and believe most people would want to be here.I was born in a small village called Matungu, surrounded by green fields and peaceful rivers. Growing up there was special, as life was simple and full of warmth. From a young age, I loved asking questions and learning about the world around me.

                When it was time for school, I joined St. Peter's High School. Those were some of the best years of my life. I made great friends and learned so much. My teachers always encouraged me to work hard and dream big. Their belief in me pushed me to aim higher.
                
                After high school, I had the chance to study online at Brigham Young University (BYU). It was a new and exciting experience for me. Studying remotely allowed me to connect with people from different places and explore new ideas. It was challenging at times, but I stayed focused and gave my best.
                
                Later, I returned to Kenya and joined Egerton University. My time there helped me grow even more. I gained knowledge and skills that prepared me for the future.
                
                From Matungu to St. Peter's, BYU, and Egerton, my journey has been full of learning and growth. I’m proud of where I’ve come from and where I’m headed. Thanks</p>

        <h3>Our purpose:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Rafting! This is the first part in our series aimed at welcoming new participants to the sport of whitewater rafting. If you are new to rafting, a first timer, or you are getting a group together and don’t know what to expect whitewater rafting you probably want to know why would you go with a rafting company and what do they provide?

            The easy answer is: Just show up and we take care of the rest. That is the mantra of any good rafting company.
            
            Rafting is an adventure sport and there is a lot to think about before your first trip, but that’s the beauty of going with a rafting company you don’t have to worry about any of it. We sat down with our friend Tyler from H20 Adventures to take a look at what he provides to his guests on every rafting trip. </p>
